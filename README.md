# Cyber Tools & Scripts | Automation & Security Utilities

## Overview
This is a bonus project where I developed **small cybersecurity tools and scripts** to automate tasks, scan networks, and practice programming for security purposes.  
The goal was to combine **coding skills with cybersecurity knowledge** to make useful utilities for labs and personal learning.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Virtualization:** VMware Workstation Pro (for testing scripts safely)  
- **Operating Systems:** Windows 10, Ubuntu Linux  
- **Languages:** Python, Bash, PowerShell  
- **Other Tools:** Nmap, Wireshark, Netcat  

---

## Example Scripts
1. **Network Scanner (Python):** Scans a subnet for live hosts and open ports.  
2. **Log Parser (Bash):** Automatically reads logs and filters suspicious entries.  
3. **Ping Sweep (PowerShell):** Checks multiple IP addresses for availability.  
4. **Simple Malware Sandbox Runner (Python):** Safely executes sample files and logs activity.  
5. **Custom Alerts Script (Python/Bash):** Notifies me of certain events in lab environments.

## Setup Steps
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine or lab VM.  
2. **Ensure dependencies** are installed: Python 3.x, PowerShell modules, Bash utilities.  
3. **Run scripts** in a safe, isolated environment.  
4. **Modify or extend scripts** to practice programming and security concepts.  
5. (Optional) **Test scripts** on lab VMs or network segments to see results.

## Screenshots / Proof
*(I added screenshots showing script output and examples of scans or log parsing.)*  

- Network scan results  
- Log parsing output  
- Custom alerts in action

## Learning Notes
- I improved my **Python, Bash, and PowerShell scripting skills** for cybersecurity tasks.  
- Automating repetitive tasks saved time and made lab testing easier.  
- Testing scripts in VMware Workstation Pro reinforced **safe cybersecurity practices**.  
- This project helped me combine **coding logic with practical security applications**.  

---

## Next Steps
- Add more advanced automation scripts for **SIEM integration** or **vulnerability scanning**.  
- Learn to deploy scripts as **scheduled tasks or cron jobs** in lab environments.  
- Share some scripts with the community on GitHub for collaboration.
